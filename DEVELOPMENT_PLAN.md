# PRISMAgent Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the development priorities for the PRISMAgent project based on a comprehensive code analysis. The goal is to transform the current early prototype into a functional framework by addressing critical issues in a prioritized manner.

## Current Status

PRISMAgent is currently in an early development stage with a well-designed architecture but incomplete implementation. Many core components are either missing, partially implemented, or disconnected. The framework shows a clear vision but requires significant work to become functional.

## Priority Matrix

| Priority | Complexity | Issue | Description |
|----------|------------|-------|-------------|
| P0 | Low | Missing tool_factory | Implement the missing tool_factory function that's referenced but doesn't exist |
| P0 | Low | Parameter mismatches | Fix inconsistencies between function signatures and calls |
| P0 | Medium | Complete storage registry | Finish basic in-memory registry implementation |
| P0 | Low | Documentation update | Update README to reflect actual vs. aspirational features |
| P1 | Medium | Basic testing | Implement unit tests for core components |
| P1 | Medium | UI adjustments | Modify UI to only expose implemented functionality |
| P1 | High | Storage abstraction | Implement proper async patterns in storage |
| P2 | High | Vector storage | Complete vector storage implementation |
| P2 | Medium | Plugin system | Design and implement plugin registry |
| P2 | Medium | Tasks module | Implement background task execution |

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (2 weeks)

Focus on making the basic system work correctly with minimal features:

1. **Week 1: Fix Critical Issues**
   - ✅ Implement missing tool_factory function
   - ✅ Fix parameter mismatches in factory calls
   - ✅ Complete basic in-memory registry
   - Update documentation to reflect current state

2. **Week 2: Minimal Viable Testing**
   - Implement basic unit tests for engine module
   - Add integration tests for simple agent creation flow
   - Create test fixtures for OpenAI API mocks
   - Add validation and error handling for parameters

## Phase 2: Storage and UI (3 weeks)

With core functionality working, expand to improve storage and user experience:

1. **Week 3-4: Storage Implementation**
   - Implement proper async patterns in storage
   - Complete file storage backend
   - Add basic persistence functionality
   - Create data migration utilities

2. **Week 5: UI Improvements**
   - Update Streamlit UI to work with implemented features
   - Improve error reporting and user feedback
   - Add diagnostics dashboard for system status
   - Create simple demo workflows

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (TBD)

Once the foundation is solid, advanced features can be added:

1. **Vector Storage**
   - Implement embedding generation
   - Add semantic search capabilities
   - Integrate with backend

2. **Plugin System**
   - Design plugin discovery mechanism
   - Create plugin registry
   - Add sample plugins

3. **Tasks Module**
   - Implement background job execution
   - Add scheduling capabilities
   - Create task monitoring interface

## Immediate Action Items

The following tasks should be started immediately:

1. ~~**Create tool_factory implementation**~~
   - ~~Owner: [Assign Developer]~~
   - ~~Deadline: [Date]~~
   - ~~Expected files: `src/PRISMAgent/tools/factory.py`~~
   - ~~Success criteria: All tool-related functions work without errors~~
   - **Status:** ✅ Completed

2. ~~**Audit and fix parameter mismatches**~~
   - ~~Owner: [Assign Developer]~~
   - ~~Deadline: [Date]~~
   - ~~Expected changes: Multiple files~~
   - ~~Success criteria: All function calls match their declarations~~
   - **Status:** ✅ Completed

3. ~~**Complete in-memory registry**~~
   - ~~Owner: [Assign Developer]~~
   - ~~Deadline: [Date]~~
   - ~~Expected files: `src/PRISMAgent/storage/memory_backend.py`~~
   - ~~Success criteria: Basic CRUD operations work for agents~~
   - **Status:** ✅ Completed - Registry Protocol fully implemented in all backends

4. **Update documentation**
   - Owner: [Assign Developer]
   - Deadline: [Date]
   - Expected files: `README.md`, `docs/`
   - Success criteria: Documentation accurately reflects implemented features

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Quality**
   - Maintain strict typing with mypy
   - Follow existing code style (Black, Ruff)
   - Keep file size under 200 LOC
   - Use factory pattern consistently

2. **Testing Requirements**
   - All new code must have unit tests
   - Integration tests for key workflows
   - Test both success and failure cases

3. **Documentation**
   - Update docs as code changes
   - Document both public API and internals
   - Include examples for key features

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Log completed tasks in CHANGELOG.md
   - Update open_questions.txt for uncertainties
   - Regular status updates in team meetings

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| [Date] | Focus on in-memory storage first | Simplifies initial development | Delays persistent storage |
| [Date] | Remove unimplemented features from UI | Avoid user confusion | Better user experience for implemented features |
| 2025-04-24 | Fix VectorStore registry implementation | Required for properly functioning registry backends | Ensures consistent interface for agent storage across backend types |

## Open Questions

See open_questions.txt for a current list of design uncertainties and technical questions.
