# PRISMAgent Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the development priorities for the PRISMAgent project based on a comprehensive code analysis. The goal is to transform the current early prototype into a functional framework by addressing critical issues in a prioritized manner.

## Current Status

PRISMAgent has made significant progress from its early development stage. The critical infrastructure components have been implemented, including the tool factory, parameter fixes, and fully implemented registry protocol across all backends. The project is now organized with a clear roadmap and project boards to track progress on different work streams.

## Priority Matrix

| Priority | Complexity | Issue | Description | Status |
|----------|------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| P0 | Low | Missing tool_factory | Implement the missing tool_factory function that's referenced but doesn't exist | ‚úÖ Completed |
| P0 | Low | Parameter mismatches | Fix inconsistencies between function signatures and calls | ‚úÖ Completed |
| P0 | Medium | Complete storage registry | Finish basic in-memory registry implementation | ‚úÖ Completed - Registry Protocol fully implemented in all backends |
| P0 | High | Missing Async Implementation | Implement proper async patterns in storage backends | üîÑ In Progress |
| P1 | Medium | Chat History Storage | Implement chat history storage and retrieval | ‚è≥ Ready for implementation |
| P1 | High | Vector Storage | Complete vector storage implementation | ‚è≥ Ready for implementation |
| P1 | Medium | Plugin System | Design and implement plugin registry | ‚è≥ Ready for implementation |
| P1 | Medium | Tasks Module | Implement background task execution | ‚è≥ Ready for implementation |
| P1 | Medium | Basic testing | Implement unit tests for core components | ‚è≥ Ready for implementation |
| P1 | Medium | Documentation update | Update README to reflect actual vs. aspirational features | ‚è≥ Ready for implementation |
| P2 | Medium | Error Handling | Improve error handling with specific messages | ‚è≥ Ready for implementation |
| P2 | Medium | Configuration | Replace hardcoded settings with configurable options | ‚è≥ Ready for implementation |

## Project Organization

The project is now organized via GitHub Project Boards to provide better visibility and structure:

1. **Project Boards**:
   - [PRISMAgent Development Roadmap (#23)](https://github.com/rsgTom/PRISMAgent/issues/23) - Complete overview of all issues and priorities
   - [Critical Fixes & Immediate Tasks (#24)](https://github.com/rsgTom/PRISMAgent/issues/24) - Tracking urgent issues
   - [Testing & Quality Improvements (#25)](https://github.com/rsgTom/PRISMAgent/issues/25) - Test coverage and quality initiatives
   - [Feature Development & Enhancements (#26)](https://github.com/rsgTom/PRISMAgent/issues/26) - New features roadmap

2. **Current Progress**:
   - Critical Issues: 3/4 completed (75%)
   - Core Features: 0/4 completed (0%)
   - Testing Improvements: 0/3 completed (0%)
   - Infrastructure: 0/5 completed (0%)

## Immediate Focus (Current Sprint)

1. **Complete Remaining Critical Fix**:
   - C4: Missing Async Implementation in Storage Backends (#4)

2. **Begin Core Feature Implementation**:
   - Implement Chat History Storage and Retrieval (#5)
   - Start improving test coverage for Engine Module (#12)

3. **Near-Term Focus (Next Sprint)**:
   - Complete Vector Storage Implementation (#6)
   - Implement Plugin System (#7)
   - Set up CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions (#22)

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (Completed ‚úÖ)

We've successfully completed the critical fixes:

1. **Critical Fixes**:
   - ‚úÖ Implement missing tool_factory function
   - ‚úÖ Fix parameter mismatches in factory calls
   - ‚úÖ Complete basic in-memory registry
   - üîÑ Implementing async patterns in storage (in progress)

## Phase 2: Storage and Testing (In Progress üîÑ)

With core functionality stabilized, we're now focusing on:

1. **Storage Implementation**:
   - Implement proper async patterns in storage
   - Complete chat history storage and retrieval
   - Complete vector storage implementation
   - Enhance plugin system

2. **Testing Improvements**:
   - Add comprehensive tests for engine module
   - Add tests for storage backends
   - Add tests for API endpoints

## Phase 3: Quality and Developer Experience (Planned ‚è≥)

1. **Error Handling and Configuration**:
   - Improve error handling with specific messages
   - Replace hardcoded settings with configurable options
   - Update documentation to reflect current state

2. **CI/CD and Infrastructure**:
   - Set up CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
   - Implement Authentication and Security Measures
   - Add OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation for API

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Planned ‚è≥)

Once the foundation is solid, we'll proceed with:

1. **Multiple LLM Providers**:
   - Add support for Anthropic, Cohere, etc.
   - Create abstraction layer for different providers

2. **Monitoring and UI**:
   - Implement Enhanced Monitoring and Telemetry
   - Develop Web-based Admin UI

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Quality**
   - Maintain strict typing with mypy
   - Follow existing code style (Black, Ruff)
   - Keep file size under 200 LOC
   - Use factory pattern consistently

2. **Testing Requirements**
   - All new code must have unit tests
   - Integration tests for key workflows
   - Test both success and failure cases

3. **Documentation**
   - Update docs as code changes
   - Document both public API and internals
   - Include examples for key features

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Log completed tasks in CHANGELOG.md
   - Update open_questions.txt for uncertainties
   - Regular status updates in team meetings

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
